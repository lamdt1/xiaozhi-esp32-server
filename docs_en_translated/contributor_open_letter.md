# Open Letter to Developers

"When the spring river warms, the duck knows first; it's the time when the pufferfish wants to come up!"

Dear friend, I am John, an ordinary Java programmer in a regular company. Today, I write this open letter to you who love AI technology and innovation with the most sincere heart.

Six months ago, I saw many excellent projects, such as `Dify`, `Chat2DB` and other AI-related projects. I thought, how great it would be if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "no way to serve the country, just coding for ten years in vain."

I came across Xiaoge's team's videos at the beginning of 2025, and I was very curious about how they achieved it. I wanted to replicate their backend service and create a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Unfortunately, what I've created is still just an artificial idiot - it has low concurrency, no soul, slow response, and many bugs.

Xiaoge's team is our learning target. I really want to have an intelligent Xiaozhi backend service like Xiaoge's team. But I can also understand Xiaoge's decision not to open source. "One flower blooming alone is not spring, a hundred flowers blooming together makes spring full." The era of artificial intelligence blooming everywhere may be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to achieve a low-cost civilian Jarvis. I personally believe that what he can achieve, we can also achieve, it's just a matter of time. I call this "our journey to the West."

So what difficulties will we encounter on this journey to the West? I think there should be no less than eighty-one difficulties. This journey will inevitably encounter various monsters, of course, there will also be immortals secretly helping us, and people joining the journey team.

If you think the above content is funny, then I also feel very lucky. I was able to make you laugh for five seconds in your 30,000+ days of life, which can be considered as making a contribution to you.

Will this idea of a civilian low-cost Jarvis fail? I don't know, but isn't this kind of failure very common in our ordinary people's lives?

In the future, one thing is certain - someone will completely replicate Xiaoge's team's functionality and achieve a civilian low-cost Jarvis. Will this project be us?

Looking forward to walking hand in hand with you and creating the future together.
